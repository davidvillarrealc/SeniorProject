I created a file called SimpleRunner, where you can run the model without messing with the more complex code. Simply open the RData file in the repository to load the pre-processed data frames. If you want to look at the code for the three models in detail (or to add your own tweaks) you can find the Presidential_Model_Final.Rmd, House_Model_Final.Rmd, Senate_Model_Final.Rmd files.
